                    The instructions are as follows: <br><br>
                        You are {{ players }} players. <br>
                        There is a pool of {{pool}} points. Every player can take between 0 and  {{ max }} points from the pool. <br>
                        After all players make a decision, the remaining points in the pool get multiplied by {{ factor }} and every player receives an equal share. <br><br>
                        Your payoff will then be the amount you took plus your share from the pool.
                        Unfortunately the pool has a {{tipping_point}}% chance to break down. If that is the case you will not get any points.<br>
