                This is an academic research study on decision making under uncertainty of a tipping point. You will be matched with
        co-players and you will be asked to make a decision after answering two questions that test your general understanding of the topic. <br><br>

        Duration and reward:<br>
        The entire game will take 7-10 minutes. Your payment consists of a fixed reward of <b>$0.50</b> for successful completion and a bonus of <b>$0.20</b> for every point
        you earn. The points you get depend on your decision, the decision of your co-players as well as on chance. <br>
        The maximum amount you can earn, depending on your player type, is $6.50 or $2.50. <br>
        You will find out which player type you are on the next slide. <br><br>
