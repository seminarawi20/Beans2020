            The instructions are as follows: <br><br>
            You are a group of {{ players }} players. <br>
            There is a pool of {{pool}} points. Every player can take between 0 and  {{ max }} points from the pool. <br>
            After all players make a decision, the remaining points in the pool get multiplied by {{ factor }} and every player receives an equal share. <br><br>
            Your payoff will then be the amount you took plus your share from the pool.<br>

            Unfortunately, for every point that is taken from the pool, the pool's <b>probability to break down increases by {{addition_per_take}}%</b>. <br>

            <b>In case of a breakdown</b>, players have either role A or role B.<br>
            - <u>Role A:</u> If the pool breaks down, your payoff will be 0 (2 players have this role)<br>
            - <u>Role B:</u> If the pool breaks down, you will only get the points you took from the pool. Therefore, you are less affected by the breakdown than the other players are. (1 player has this role)<br><br>

        <b>You have role B.</b><br>
            Keep in mind, that the other players have a different role.<br>
