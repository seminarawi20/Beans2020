        This is a test for Tillmann + test <br>

        {% if treatment == 1 %}
            <! This is the statement for the treatment group >
            The instructions are as follows: <br><br>
                You are {{ players }} players. <br>
                There is a pool of {{pool}} points. Every player can take between 0 and  {{ max }} points from the pool. <br>
                After all players make a decision, the remaining points in the pool get multiplied by {{ factor }} and every player receives an equal share. <br><br>
                Your payoff will then be the amount you took plus your share from the pool.<br>
                Unfortunately the pool has a tipping point between {{tipping_point_min}} and {{tipping_point_max}} points. <br>
                If less points remain in the pool after all players made their choice, the pool will break down and you will not get any points.<br>

           <! This is the statement for the control group >
           The instructions are as follows: <br><br>

                There is a pool of {{pool}} points. Every player can take between 0 and  {{ max }} points from the pool. <br>
                After all players make a decision, the remaining points in the pool get multiplied by {{ factor }} and every player receives an equal share. <br><br>
                Your payoff will then be the amount you took plus your share from the pool.
