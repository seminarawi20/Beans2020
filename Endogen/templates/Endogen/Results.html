<! Here we need an if statement, since the players in the treatment determines if he gets info of the pool breaking down or not.
        In this special case we have a nested loop. For those the syntax remains the same as a normal loop>


    <p>
        <! This is the statement for the treatment group >
        {% if treatment == 1 %}
            You took {{take}} points. {{total_points_left}} points remained in the pool and increased to {{pool_mult}} points.<br>
            {% if breakdown == 1 %}
                Unfortunately your tipping point was {{tipping_point}} points and more points were taken from the pool. This caused the pool to break down. <br><br>
                This means you earned {{payoff}}
            {%else%}
                Fortunately your tipping point was {{tipping_point}}  and less points were taken. Therefore, the pool did not break down.<br><br>
                This means your share is {{share}} points and you earned {{payoff}}
            {% endif %} <br><br>

        {%else%}
        <! This is the statement for the control group >
        You took {{take}} points. {{total_points_left}} points remained in the pool and increased to {{pool_mult}} points.<br><br>
        This means your share is {{share}} points and you earned {{payoff}}
        {% endif %}
        <br><br>
