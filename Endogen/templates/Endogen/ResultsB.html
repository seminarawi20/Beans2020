<! Here we need an if statement, since the players in the treatment determines if he gets info of the pool breaking down or not.
        In this special case we have a nested loop. For those the syntax remains the same as a normal loop>


    <p>
        <! This is the statement for the treatment group >

            You took {{take}} points. {{total_points_left}} points remained in the pool and increased to {{pool_mult}} points.<br>
            Since {{points_taken}} points were taken, the chance that the pool broke down was at {{tipping_point}}%.<br>
            {% if breakdown == 1 %}
                Unfortunately the pool broke down. <br><br>
                This means you earned {{payoff}}
            {%else%}
                Fortunately the pool did not break down. <br><br>
                This means your share is {{share}} points and you earned {{payoff}}
            {% endif %} <br><br>

        <! This is the statement for the control group >
        You took {{take}} points. {{total_points_left}} points remained in the pool and increased to {{pool_mult}} points.<br><br>
        This means your share is {{share}} points and you earned {{payoff}}

        You completion code is <b>{{ completion_code }}</b>
