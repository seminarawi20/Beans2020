            Your answer is <b>correct</b>. <br><br>
            Since the pool breaks down you will only get the points you originally took out.  <br>

        {%else%}
            Your answer is <b>false</b>. <br><br>
            Remember that you are player <b>type A</b> and you only earn bonus points if the pool does not break down. <br>
            Since the pool breaks down every player will only get the points they took out. <br>
            Therefore you would get 10 points. <br>
