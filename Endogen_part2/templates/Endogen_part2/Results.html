<! Here we need an if statement, since the players in the treatment determines if he gets info of the pool breaking down or not.
        In this special case we have a nested loop. For those the syntax remains the same as a normal loop>


    <p>
        <! This is the statement for the treatment group >
        {% if treatment == 1 %}
            You took {{ take }} points. {{ total_points_left }} points remained in the pool.<br>
            Since {{ points_taken }} points were taken in total, the chance that the pool broke down was at {{ tipping_point }}%.<br>
            {% if breakdown == 1 %}
        <b>Unfortunately, the pool broke down</b>. <br><br>
                This means you earned a total of {{payoff}}. <br>
                Reminder: Each point ist worth ${{ rate }} and you receive ${{ base }} for participating.
            {% else %}
                <b>Fortunately, the pool did not break down</b>. <br><br>
                This means your share is {{ share }} points and you earned a total of {{ payoff }}.
