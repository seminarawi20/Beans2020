            Your answer is <b>correct</b>. <br><br>
            Since the pool breaks down every player will only get the points they took. <br>

            Your answer is <b>false</b>. <br><br>
            Remember that you are player <b>type B</b> and you always get the points you took out, whether the pool breaks down or not. <br>
            Therefore you would get 10 points. <br>
